# Me + Rhees learing how to make a neural network

Good article on how to do it from scratch "https://www.kaggle.com/code/soham1024/basic-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python"

# Where we learned it

This video and this github is what I followed:
- https://github.com/lukepolson/youtube_channel/blob/main/Python%20Tutorial%20Series/pytorch4.ipynb

# Questions

- Where are these random numbers coming from and do they matter? (`batch_size` = 5, `epoch` = 20, `lr=0.01`) etc
- Understading the `MyNeuralNet` class more (why 3 matrix's?, understanding the foward pass more?)
- dont know what `squeeze` or `view` does
- understanding why everything is a tensor
- `RELU`
- The cross entropy loss function 
- Stochastic gradient descecnt
- why zero out the gradient
