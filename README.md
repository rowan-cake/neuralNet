# Me + Rhees learing how to make a neural network

Good article on how to do it from scratch "https://www.kaggle.com/code/soham1024/basic-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python"

# Where we learned it

This video and this github is what I followed:
- https://github.com/lukepolson/youtube_channel/blob/main/Python%20Tutorial%20Series/pytorch4.ipynb
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBw0u_5u0qU&t=607s

# Questions

1. Where are these random numbers coming from and do they matter? (`batch_size` = 5, `epoch` = 20, `lr=0.01`) etc
2. Understading the `MyNeuralNet` class more (why 3 matrix's?, understanding the foward pass more?)
3. dont know what `squeeze` or `view` does
4. understanding why everything is a tensor
5. `RELU`
6. The cross entropy loss function 
7. Stochastic gradient descecnt
8. why zero out the gradient

# Anserws
1. `lr=0.01` stands for learning rate and is a hyper paremeter in Stochastic gradient descecnt
